##About the app

In March 2019 I started my journey into web development. I learn to develop websites and apps professionally. To finish a web development bootcamp I was asked to build my own app in four weeks until the end of June 2019. This is the result.

During my studies, I wished for a good opportunity to quickly and effectively exchange information with my roommates about everyday matters. Since my roommates and fellow students also wanted to organize their daily tasks and plans more quickly, I programmed this app.

Two of the most frequently and longest discussed topics are shopping and household tasks, which is why I have put my focus on them.
